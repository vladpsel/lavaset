# lavaset
Laravel based web application with some basic functions. For example simple user roles, some universal migration files and other.

## Anti-toxic copyright

This is not new bicycle. This is just my own vision on Laravel web-abb. Web app with simple user-roles, notifications 
and other things. Without complication function and logic. And withour third-party packages for some features.

I create this repo only for my work and pet projects. And if some developer will serve project written by me, this repo 
should help him to understand my code and logic. Also i can develop my projects faster and maybe someone will find my preset useful.

Main idea for this repo is "pull - change setting - develop". For now this repo contains last version of Laravel (9.x.x). And i hope
I will support this preset.
